# Therapy Navigation System - Development Guide

## Project Overview
A brainspotting therapy navigation system with AI-powered coaching and automated phase transitions.

## Key Breakthroughs

### ðŸŽ‰ Auto-Transition System (2025-09-19)
Successfully implemented automatic phase transitions that eliminate the need for AI to make multiple tool calls:

**Problem**: AI was collecting required data but not transitioning phases, causing workflow to stall.

**Solution**: Added auto-transition logic in `collect_structured_data` tool:
- When all phase requirements are met (`ready_to_transition: true`)
- Backend automatically calls transition internally
- No dependency on AI making multiple tool calls in single response

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/internal/mcp/server.go` - Added auto-transition logic
- `backend/internal/services/coach.go` - Added FunctionCallingConfig (removed due to Go SDK limitations)

**Results**:
- âœ… Pre-session â†’ Issue Decision transition working
- âœ… Automatic progression when requirements met
- âœ… More reliable than depending on AI multi-tool behavior

### Gemini MCP Integration
- Gemini DOES support multiple function calls (parallel + sequential)
- Go SDK lacks `FunctionCallingConfig` field, but auto-transition compensates
- Hardcoded tools provide reliability while maintaining flexibility

## Architecture

### Backend (`/backend`)
- **Go + Gin + GORM + SQLite**
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol for AI tool integration
- **Auto-Transition**: Phase progression logic in data collection
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates to frontend

### Frontend (`/frontend`)
- **React + TypeScript + Vite**
- **Real-time UI**: WebSocket integration for live session updates
- **Phase Visualization**: Workflow state machine display

## Development Setup

### Tmux Configuration

We use tmux for managing development processes:

#### Window Layout
- Window 0: Backend (`GORM_LOG_LEVEL=info go run cmd/server/main.go`)
- Window 1: Frontend (`npm run dev`)
- Window 2: Backend/Air hot reload (`air`)

#### Key Commands
```bash
# List tmux sessions
tmux ls

# Switch to window
Ctrl-b [window-number]

# Kill current pane/process
Ctrl-c (in pane)
```

### Database Management
- Database file: `backend/therapy.db`
- Backup before major changes: `cp backend/therapy.db backend/therapy_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db`
- Move aside for fresh migrations: `mv backend/therapy.db backend/therapy_aside_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db`

### Fresh Test Process
1. Move database aside: `mv backend/therapy.db backend/therapy_aside_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db`
2. Restart air in tmux window 2: `Ctrl-c` then `air`
3. Air will auto-rebuild with fresh database and run migrations

### Complete Fresh Test Checklist
When doing a fresh test after code changes:
1. âœ… Move database aside for fresh start
2. âœ… Review and update prompts if needed (especially workflow instructions)
3. âœ… Fix any logging issues (e.g., from_phase showing wrong value)
4. âœ… Add debug logging for problem areas
5. âœ… Check for unexpected auto-transition logic
6. âœ… Fix ready_to_transition calculation (must check ALL collected data for phase, not just current call)
7. âœ… Document changes in CLAUDE.md
8. âœ… Restart air with fresh database

The system is ready when air rebuilds with fresh migrations!

## Testing Workflow
1. Start fresh session via "ðŸ§  Quick Coach Session"
2. Use realistic, vulnerable client responses
3. Observe auto-transitions in real-time
4. Check logs for transition success/failure

### Ports
- Frontend runs on port 5173
- Backend API on port 8083 (HTTP + WebSocket)
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing

## Current Status
- âœ… Pre-session â†’ Issue Decision: Working
- âœ… Issue Decision â†’ Information Gathering: Working
- âœ… All 10 phases defined with proper data requirements
- âœ… Phase colors and glass morphism UI restored
- ðŸ”„ Implementing automatic transition messages

## Next Steps
1. Test complete 10-phase workflow progression
2. Verify stage 4-5-6 loop behavior
3. Refine therapeutic prompts for realism
